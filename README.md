## Ex. No. 7 – Develop a Prompt-Based Application using Large Language Models
## Register No: 212223240024

# Aim:

To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT that organizes daily tasks, manages schedules, and provides wellness suggestions — demonstrating the progression from simple to advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# AI Tools Required:

ChatGPT (Large Language Model)

Python (optional for interface simulation)

Google Colab / Command-line interface (for implementation)

# Explanation:

Prompt engineering allows users to design custom AI-based applications without coding complex logic.
In this exercise, a Personal Productivity Assistant is created using prompt-based interaction. The assistant helps manage daily tasks, set reminders, provide wellness tips, and answer general queries through natural language.

# Prompt:

"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."

# Procedure:

Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant (task management, scheduling, reminders, wellness advice).

Design structured prompts for each function and test responses using ChatGPT.

Simulate user interaction through a text-based interface (e.g., command-line or chat simulation).

Collect feedback or sample inputs to adapt the AI’s responses for personalization.

(Optional) Add memory simulation, allowing the assistant to recall user preferences for future interactions.

# Expected Output:

# Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant – Features
# 1. Daily Task Manager

Accepts natural language commands:
Example: “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM.”

Organizes tasks by priority, category, and deadline.

Generates daily summaries of completed and pending tasks.

# 2. Smart Scheduler

Schedules events and sets contextual reminders.

Detects conflicting appointments and suggests alternative times.

Recommends free time slots for breaks or self-care.

# 3. Wellness Tips Generator

Provides daily wellness suggestions like hydration reminders, exercise prompts, and digital detox breaks.

Adapts based on past feedback (e.g., if user prefers yoga tips over gym workouts).

# 4. General Query Assistant

Answers everyday questions related to academics, productivity, or lifestyle.

Offers motivational quotes or focus techniques when requested.

# Result:

The lab exercise successfully demonstrated the creation of a prompt-based personal assistant prototype powered by a large language model (ChatGPT).
Students were able to:

Understand how to design and structure effective prompts for real-life applications.

Foster creativity in developing AI-based productivity tools.

Apply prompt engineering for context-aware, natural interactions.

Experience how generative AI can enhance organization, well-being, and efficiency in daily life.
